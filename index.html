        <h1>Edgar Degas</h1>
        <p>Degas was nicknamed the “painter of dancers”. From 1860 onwards, he developed a fascination with dance, which was originally discovered at the Paris Opera, where he spent much time backstage. As a result of his interest, his paintings portrayed the dancers in private behind-the-scenes moments, as well as during their performances on stage. Take a look back over the love story between the artist and his tutu-clad muses.</p>
